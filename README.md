# Hey-Day-script
Hey day is an Auburn University tradition. It is a day where students and faculty wear a name tag and say hey to eachother. The goal is for each student to have sense of belonging to the Auburn family.
This tradition dates back all the way to WWII. It started when the students that served in the war returned to campus. They started "hey day" to make sure students felt like they were seen.
